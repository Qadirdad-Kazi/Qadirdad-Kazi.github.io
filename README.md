<h1>Portfolio Website HTML/CSS</h1>
<p> <b>This GitHub repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. Built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript,
it showcases my skills, projects, education, and more. The website features a clean and modern design with sections for an 
introduction, about me, education journey, skills, and projects I've worked on. It also includes links to my social media profiles 
for easy connection. Explore the code to get insights into my coding style and project presentation.<b> </b></p>
